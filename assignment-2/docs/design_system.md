# Fonts/Colours

Our Yatzy game uses Arial as its primary font. We chose it for its readability across different browsers and devices. The game interface features a soft grayish white background (#f4f4f4). The dice elements are presented in white (#fff), ensuring clear differentiation between the dice and the background. Their subtle border color (#ccc), is slightly darker than the background in order to add depth and a shadow-like effect to the dice. If the player chooses to click on a dice to keep them for the next roll, the dice is grayed out. The majority of our elements maintain a uniform font size of 16, with exceptions made for the game title, dice, and scoreboard headers. We made this decision to ensure that crucial elements of the game are easily distinguishable.

# Structural Components

Our game uses various components for interaction and display. We utilize buttons for rolling the dice, selecting scoring categories, and resetting the game state. A table is used to present scores for each score category and calculate the total score (scoreboard). Additionally, we display dice and their values in 50px square formats, ensuring clear visibility during gameplay.
